## Briefly about myself:
Currently I'm a student of Uzbekistan State World Languages University in Tashkent. A year ago I decided to try myself in Frontend Developing, because I like to do this kind of staff, such as crating web-sites and applications. 

First, I've already finished one good course on HTML5 and CSS3 on Udemy, that formed the basis for my study. With a help of it, I could manage to create a modern HTML and CSS based web-site by myself! 

Then, I also started to learn Javascript with a help of course on the same platform which is now in progress. I've already studied some basics of JS and I could even write some not sophisticated algorithms!

I believe that in the not so far future my skills will lead me through the path of becoming a proficient JavaScript Software Engineer!
